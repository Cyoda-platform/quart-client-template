The requirement you've provided is clear and sufficient for creating the Cyoda design. It outlines the need for an application that fetches a list of books via an API and enriches the response by adding cover photos for each book, which will be retrieved through a separate API call using the book's ID. 

At this stage, I understand that we need to focus on outlining the entities related to books and their workflows for fetching and enriching data without diving into API documentation or implementation details.

I am ready to proceed with developing the Cyoda design JSON based on this requirement. Please let me know if there are any specific aspects you would like to emphasize or if there are additional instructions!
