The requirement is clear and sufficient for creating the Cyoda design. You have specified that the application will retrieve pet details and ingest these details based on different statuses (available, sold, pending). This information is adequate to outline the necessary entities and their workflows.

I am ready to proceed with creating the Cyoda design JSON based on the provided specifications. Please let me know if you have any additional instructions or if you want me to go ahead with the design JSON.
