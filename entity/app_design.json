The requirement is somewhat clear, but it lacks sufficient detail for creating a comprehensive Cyoda design. While you have mentioned a "single entity" and an "API request," it is unclear what specific data this entity should manage or the kinds of workflows that are expected.

To proceed effectively, I would need clarification on the following points:
1. What kind of data should the single entity represent? (e.g., pet details, user information, etc.)
2. What specific actions or workflows should be associated with this entity? (e.g., ingestion, retrieval, updates?)
3. Are there any specific statuses or parameters that need to be considered for the entity?

Once these details are clarified, I will be better positioned to create an appropriate Cyoda design JSON. Please provide any additional information when ready!
