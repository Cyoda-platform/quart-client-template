# ``` 
# 
# ### Explanation of the Code:
# 1. **`fetch_books()` Function**:
#    - Asynchronously fetches data from the book API.
#    - Returns the list of books in JSON format if the request is successful.
# 
# 2. **`fetch_cover_photo(book_id)` Function**:
#    - Asynchronously fetches the cover photo URL for a specific book based on its ID.
#    - Returns the URL if successful.
# 
# 3. **`ingest_data()` Function**:
#    - Orchestrates the data fetching from both APIs.
#    - It processes and returns a list of books with their respective cover photo URLs.
# 
# 4. **`TestDataIngestion` Class**:
#    - Contains a unit test to verify the functionality of the `ingest_data()` function.
#    - Confirms that the processed data structure is as expected and that it contains the necessary fields.
# 
# This code can be run in an isolated environment to test the functionality of fetching and processing book data and their cover photos.
