More tools = more complexity! \ud83d\ude2c I prefer simpler systems with fewer parts that fit together. But as tech improves, systems get harder to connect. \ud83d\ude15\n\nI love creating things that work quickly. So, how can we simplify? \ud83e\udd14 Systems really only do three things:\n1. Take in information \ud83d\udce8\n2. Change, delete, or create info \ud83d\udd04\n3. Make info accessible \ud83d\udd0d\n\nBut we need **information**\u2014not just data! \ud83d\udcda\n\nMost systems need a database. But let\u2019s go beyond storage and process data too. Think of it as a \"smart\" database that does more! \ud83d\ude0e\n\n**Entities Make It Easier!**  \nWe don\u2019t think in tables or numbers\u2014we think in real-world things! \ud83e\udd14 A database should focus on **entities**\u2014things that have a start, middle, and end, like orders or payments. These entities change over time and follow rules, like a workflow. \u23f3\n\n**Why Entity State Machines are Great!**  \nViewing data as \"entities\" makes it easier to understand and use. It\u2019s like mapping out real-life processes. \ud83d\udd04 And you can change things without breaking the system. \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**The Entity Database (EDBMS)**  \nAn EDBMS keeps everything simple by managing processes and rules inside the database. It\u2019s like having a smart assistant for your business. \ud83d\ude0e Great for industries like healthcare, manufacturing, or customer management, where data and processes are tightly linked.\n\nLet\u2019s build better, simpler systems! \ud83d\ude80\n\nFor more on entity databases, check out this article by [Paul Schleger](https://medium.com/@paul_42036/whats-an-entity-database-11f8538b631a).\n",

It explains how the Cyoda design aligns with the specified requirements, focusing on the structure of entities, workflows, and the event-driven architecture that powers the application. The design is represented in a Cyoda JSON format, which is translated into a human-readable document for clarity.\n\n## What is Cyoda?\n\nCyoda is a serverless, event-driven framework that facilitates the management of workflows through entities representing jobs and data. Each entity has a defined state, and transitions between states are governed by events that occur within the system, enabling a responsive and scalable architecture.\n\n### Cyoda Entity Database\n\nIn the Cyoda ecosystem, entities are fundamental components that represent processes and data. The Cyoda design JSON outlines several entities for our application:\n\n1. **Book Data Ingestion Job (`book_data_ingestion_job`)**:\n   - **Type**: JOB\n   - **Source**: SCHEDULED\n   - **Description**: This job is responsible for ingesting book data from the specified API.\n\n2. **Book Entity (`book_entity`)**:\n   - **Type**: EXTERNAL_SOURCES_PULL_BASED_RAW_DATA\n   - **Source**: ENTITY_EVENT\n   - **Description**: This entity stores the raw data of books that have been ingested by the ingestion job.\n\n### Workflow Overview\n\nThe workflows in Cyoda define the processes tied to each job entity. The `book_data_ingestion_job` includes the following transition:\n\n- **Start Data Ingestion**: This transition triggers the ingestion of book data from the API and creates the `book_entity`.\n\n### Event-Driven Approach\n\nAn event-driven architecture allows the application to respond automatically to changes or triggers. In this specific requirement, the following events occur:\n\n- **Data Ingestion**: Triggered by the job, which fetches the list of books from the API.\n- **Saving Entities**: The raw data of books is saved as `book_entity`.\n\nThis approach promotes scalability and efficiency by allowing the application to handle each process step automatically without manual intervention.\n\n### Flowchart for Book Data Ingestion Workflow\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Initial State] -->|transition: start_data_ingestion, processor: ingest_book_data| B[Data Ingested]\n    B --> C[End State]\n\n    %% Decision point for criteria\n    B -->|criteria: API Call Successful| D1{Decision: Check Criteria}\n    D1 -->|true| C\n    D1 -->|false| E[Error: API Call Failed]\n\n    class A,B,C,D1 automated;\n```\n\n### Entity Relationships Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[book_data_ingestion_job] -->|triggers| B[book_entity];\n```\n\n### Sequence Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Scheduler\n    participant Book Data Ingestion Job\n    participant Book Entity\n\n    User->>Scheduler: Schedule book data ingestion job\n    Scheduler->>Book Data Ingestion Job: Trigger data ingestion\n    Book Data Ingestion Job->>Book Entity: Ingest book data\n    Book Entity-->>Book Data Ingestion Job: Book data saved\n```\n\n## Actors Involved\n\n- **User**: Initiates the scheduling of the book data ingestion job.\n- **Scheduler**: Responsible for triggering the job at predefined times.\n- **Book Data Ingestion Job**: Central to managing the workflow of book data processing.\n- **Book Entity**: Stores the ingested book data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Cyoda design effectively aligns with the requirements for creating a robust application for fetching and enriching book data. By utilizing the event-driven model, the application efficiently manages state transitions of each entity involved, from data ingestion to saving the entities. The outlined entities, workflows, and events comprehensively cover the needs of the application.\n\nThis PRD serves as a foundation for implementation and development, guiding the technical team through the specifics of the Cyoda architecture while providing clarity for users who may be new to the Cyoda framework.",

It explains how the Cyoda design aligns with the specified requirements, focusing on the structure of entities, workflows, and the event-driven architecture that powers the application. The design is represented in a Cyoda JSON format, which is translated into a human-readable document for clarity.\n\n## What is Cyoda?\n\nCyoda is a serverless, event-driven framework that facilitates the management of workflows through entities representing jobs and data. Each entity has a defined state, and transitions between states are governed by events that occur within the system, enabling a responsive and scalable architecture.\n\n### Cyoda Entity Database\n\nIn the Cyoda ecosystem, entities are fundamental components that represent processes and data. The Cyoda design JSON outlines several entities for our application:\n\n1. **Book Data Ingestion Job (`book_data_ingestion_job`)**:\n   - **Type**: JOB\n   - **Source**: API_REQUEST\n   - **Description**: This job is responsible for ingesting book data from the specified API.\n\n2. **Book Entity (`book_entity`)**:\n   - **Type**: EXTERNAL_SOURCES_PULL_BASED_RAW_DATA\n   - **Source**: ENTITY_EVENT\n   - **Description**: This entity stores the raw data of books that have been ingested by the ingestion job.\n\n### Workflow Overview\n\nThe workflows in Cyoda define the processes tied to each job entity. The `book_data_ingestion_job` includes the following transition:\n\n- **Start Data Ingestion**: This transition triggers the ingestion of book data from the API and creates the `book_entity`.\n\n### Event-Driven Approach\n\nAn event-driven architecture allows the application to respond automatically to changes or triggers. In this specific requirement, the following events occur:\n\n- **Data Ingestion**: Triggered by the job, which fetches the list of books from the API.\n- **Saving Entities**: The raw data of books is saved as `book_entity`.\n\nThis approach promotes scalability and efficiency by allowing the application to handle each process step automatically without manual intervention.\n\n### Flowchart for Book Data Ingestion Workflow\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Initial State] -->|transition: start_data_ingestion, processor: ingest_book_data| B[Data Ingested]\n    B --> C[End State]\n\n    %% Decision point for criteria\n    B -->|criteria: API Call Successful| D1{Decision: Check Criteria}\n    D1 -->|true| C\n    D1 -->|false| E[Error: API Call Failed]\n\n    class A,B,C,D1 automated;\n```\n\n### Entity Relationships Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[book_data_ingestion_job] -->|triggers| B[book_entity];\n```\n\n### Sequence Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant API\n    participant Book Data Ingestion Job\n    participant Book Entity\n\n    User->>API: Initiate book data ingestion\n    API->>Book Data Ingestion Job: Trigger data ingestion\n    Book Data Ingestion Job->>Book Entity: Ingest book data\n    Book Entity-->>Book Data Ingestion Job: Book data saved\n```\n\n## Actors Involved\n\n- **User**: Initiates the API call for book data ingestion.\n- **API**: Responsible for triggering the book data ingestion job.\n- **Book Data Ingestion Job**: Central to managing the workflow of book data processing.\n- **Book Entity**: Stores the ingested book data.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Cyoda design effectively aligns with the requirements for creating a robust application for fetching and enriching book data. By utilizing the event-driven model, the application efficiently manages state transitions of each entity involved, from data ingestion to saving the entities. The outlined entities, workflows, and events comprehensively cover the needs of the application.\n\nThis PRD serves as a foundation for implementation and development, guiding the technical team through the specifics of the Cyoda architecture while providing clarity for users who may be new to the Cyoda framework.",

Based on the user suggestions if there are any.  Please make sure you are re-using all raw_data_*/connections/connection.py ingest_data functions. This is very important not to re-implement ingest_data but reuse it. You should import and reuse all ingest_data functions, use 'as' to avoid names duplicates. Make sure the result of data ingestion is saved to the corresponding raw data entity. Please also make sure that you understand that argument 'data' that you pass to each function corresponds to entity/book_data_ingestion_job/book_data_ingestion_job.json data and not to any other entity!

This is the main processor function that orchestrates the ingestion of book data.\n   - It utilizes the `ingest_data` function to fetch raw book data from the API and then saves it to a raw data entity.\n   - After saving the raw data, it processes each book and saves them as `book_entity`.\n\n2. **Testing with Mocks**:\n   - The unit test class `TestBookDataIngestion` mocks the `ingest_data` function and the `add_item` method from `entity_service`.\n   - It checks whether the function behaves as expected by asserting that the correct number of calls were made and that data was saved accurately.\n\n### User Suggestions:\n- I have ensured that the `ingest_data` function from the `connections.py` file is reused instead of re-implementing any similar logic.\n- The processor function and tests are designed to be ready for immediate execution in an isolated environment. \n\nIf you have any further requests or adjustments needed, please let me know!",

Make sure you include logic to save any dependant entities: book_entity. Also generate tests with mocks for external services or functions so that the user can try out the functions right away in isolated environment. **Tests should be in the same file with the code**book_data_ingestion_job. Based on the user suggestions if there are any.  Please make sure you are re-using all raw_data_*/connections/connection.py ingest_data functions. This is very important not to re-implement ingest_data but reuse it. You should import and reuse all ingest_data functions, use 'as' to avoid names duplicates. Make sure the result of data ingestion is saved to the corresponding raw data entity. Please also make sure that you understand that argument 'data' that you pass to each function corresponds to entity/book_data_ingestion_job/book_data_ingestion_job.json data and not to any other entity!

This API will utilize the entity service to save the job data and will include a test suite with mocks to validate its functionality in an isolated environment.\n\n### Implementation of `api.py`\n\n```python\nfrom quart import Quart, request, jsonify\nimport logging\nfrom app_init.app_init import entity_service\nfrom common.config.config import ENTITY_VERSION\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\napp = Quart(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/api/v1/book_data_ingestion_job', methods=['POST'])\nasync def save_book_data_ingestion_job():\n    \"\"\"Endpoint to save the book_data_ingestion_job entity.\"\"\"\n    data = await request.get_json()\n    token = request.headers.get(\"Authorization\")  # Assume token is passed in Authorization header\n\n    if not token:\n        return jsonify({\"error\": \"Authorization token is required\"}), 401\n\n    try:\n        # Validate and prepare data if needed\n        # Save the entity using the entity service\n        job_entity = await entity_service.add_item(token, \"book_data_ingestion_job\", ENTITY_VERSION, data)\n        logger.info(f\"Book data ingestion job saved successfully: {job_entity}\")\n\n        return jsonify({\"job_id\": job_entity}), 201  # Returning the ID of the saved job entity\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Error saving book_data_ingestion_job: {e}\")\n        return jsonify({\"error\": str(e)}), 500\n\n# Testing with Mocks\nimport unittest\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass TestSaveBookDataIngestionJob(unittest.TestCase):\n\n    @patch(\"app_init.app_init.entity_service.add_item\")\n    async def test_save_book_data_ingestion_job(self, mock_add_item):\n        # Setup\n        mock_add_item.return_value = \"job_id_123\"\n        app.testing = True\n        client = app.test_client()\n\n        # Mock the request headers and data\n        headers = {\"Authorization\": \"Bearer test_token\"}\n        json_data = {\n            \"job_name\": \"Daily Book Data Ingestion\",\n            \"scheduled_time\": \"2023-10-01T05:00:00Z\",\n            \"status\": \"completed\"\n        }\n\n        # Act: Make a POST request to save the job\n        response = await client.post('/api/v1/book_data_ingestion_job', headers=headers, json=json_data)\n\n        # Assert\n        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 201)\n        self.assertEqual(response.get_json(), {\"job_id\": \"job_id_123\"})\n        mock_add_item.assert_called_once_with(\"Bearer test_token\", \"book_data_ingestion_job\", ENTITY_VERSION, json_data)\n\n    @patch(\"app_init.app_init.entity_service.add_item\")\n    async def test_save_book_data_ingestion_job_no_token(self, mock_add_item):\n        # Setup\n        app.testing = True\n        client = app.test_client()\n\n        # Mock the request data\n        json_data = {\n            \"job_name\": \"Daily Book Data Ingestion\",\n            \"scheduled_time\": \"2023-10-01T05:00:00Z\",\n            \"status\": \"completed\"\n        }\n\n        # Act: Make a POST request without authorization header\n        response = await client.post('/api/v1/book_data_ingestion_job', json=json_data)\n\n        # Assert\n        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 401)\n        self.assertIn(\"Authorization token is required\", response.get_json()[\"error\"])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **API Endpoint**:\n   - The `/api/v1/book_data_ingestion_job` endpoint is defined to handle POST requests for saving the `book_data_ingestion_job` entity.\n   - It expects a JSON payload representing the job data and an authorization token in the request headers.\n   - It calls the `add_item` method from the entity service to save the job details and returns the job ID upon success.\n\n2. **Testing with Mocks**:\n   - The `TestSaveBookDataIngestionJob` class contains two test methods:\n     - **`test_save_book_data_ingestion_job`**: Tests the successful saving of the job entity and checks that the correct data was passed to the service.\n     - **`test_save_book_data_ingestion_job_no_token`**: Tests the error handling when the authorization token is missing.\n\n### User Suggestions:\n- The implementation directly reflects user requirements, ensuring the endpoint is designed to accept job data and handle token-based authentication.\n- The tests are included within the same file, ready for immediate execution in an isolated environment.\n\nIf you have any further requests or adjustments needed, please let me know!",
