More tools = more complexity! \ud83d\ude2c I prefer simpler systems with fewer parts that fit together. But as tech improves, systems get harder to connect. \ud83d\ude15\n\nI love creating things that work quickly. So, how can we simplify? \ud83e\udd14 Systems really only do three things:\n1. Take in information \ud83d\udce8\n2. Change, delete, or create info \ud83d\udd04\n3. Make info accessible \ud83d\udd0d\n\nBut we need **information**\u2014not just data! \ud83d\udcda\n\nMost systems need a database. But let\u2019s go beyond storage and process data too. Think of it as a \"smart\" database that does more! \ud83d\ude0e\n\n**Entities Make It Easier!**  \nWe don\u2019t think in tables or numbers\u2014we think in real-world things! \ud83e\udd14 A database should focus on **entities**\u2014things that have a start, middle, and end, like orders or payments. These entities change over time and follow rules, like a workflow. \u23f3\n\n**Why Entity State Machines are Great!**  \nViewing data as \"entities\" makes it easier to understand and use. It\u2019s like mapping out real-life processes. \ud83d\udd04 And you can change things without breaking the system. \ud83d\udcaa\n\n**The Entity Database (EDBMS)**  \nAn EDBMS keeps everything simple by managing processes and rules inside the database. It\u2019s like having a smart assistant for your business. \ud83d\ude0e Great for industries like healthcare, manufacturing, or customer management, where data and processes are tightly linked.\n\nLet\u2019s build better, simpler systems! \ud83d\ude80\n\nFor more on entity databases, check out this article by [Paul Schleger](https://medium.com/@paul_42036/whats-an-entity-database-11f8538b631a).\n",

It details how the Cyoda design aligns with the specified requirements, focusing on the structure of entities, workflows, and the event-driven architecture that powers the application. The design is represented in a Cyoda JSON format and is translated into a human-readable document for clarity.\n\n## Cyoda Design Overview\n\nThe Cyoda design JSON describes a structured approach to managing workflows through entities that represent jobs and data. Each entity has a defined state, and transitions between states are governed by events that occur within the system, enabling a responsive and scalable architecture.\n\n### Key Components of the Design\n\n1. **Entities**: \n   - **pet_details_job** (JOB): This entity is responsible for ingesting pet details based on their statuses.\n   - **pet_details_entity** (EXTERNAL_SOURCES_PULL_BASED_RAW_DATA): This entity stores the ingested pet details.\n\n2. **Workflows**: The `pet_details_job` involves a single transition that initiates the ingestion of pet details from an API.\n\n3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: The design leverages an event-driven model where the `pet_details_job` triggers the creation of `pet_details_entity` when data ingestion occurs.\n\n## Workflows and Flowcharts\n\n### Workflow Flowchart for pet_details_job\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n   A[Initial State] -->|transition: ingest_pet_details, processor: ingest_pet_process, processor attributes: sync_process=false| B[pet_details_ingested]\n   \n   class A,B automated;\n```\n\n### Sequence Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant Scheduler\n    participant petDetailsJob\n    participant petDetailsEntity\n\n    User->>Scheduler: Schedule pet details job\n    Scheduler->>petDetailsJob: Trigger data ingestion job\n    petDetailsJob->>petDetailsEntity: Ingest pet details\n    petDetailsEntity-->>petDetailsJob: Pet details ingested\n```\n\n### Entity Relationships Diagram\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[pet_details_job] -->|triggers| B[pet_details_entity];\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Cyoda design effectively meets the requirements for building an application that retrieves pet details. By utilizing an event-driven architecture, the application can efficiently manage state transitions of each entity involved, from job initiation to data ingestion. The outlined entities, workflows, and events comprehensively cover the needs of the application, ensuring a smooth and automated process.\n\nThis PRD serves as a foundation for implementation and development, guiding the technical team through the specifics of the Cyoda architecture while providing clarity for users new to the Cyoda framework.",

Make sure you include logic to save any dependant entities: pet_details_entity. Also generate tests with mocks for external services or functions so that the user can try out the functions right away in isolated environment. **Tests should be in the same file with the code**pet_details_job. Based on the user suggestions if there are any.  Please make sure you are re-using all raw_data_*/connections/connection.py ingest_data functions. This is very important not to re-implement ingest_data but reuse it. You should import and reuse all ingest_data functions, use 'as' to avoid names duplicates. Make sure the result of data ingestion is saved to the corresponding raw data entity. Please also make sure that you understand that argument 'data' that you pass to each function corresponds to entity/pet_details_job/pet_details_job.json data and not to any other entity! User says: "
