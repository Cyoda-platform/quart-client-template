Understood. To follow the new best practice and requirements, I will move all asynchronous logic that happens right before persisting or related to entity enrichment into the corresponding `process_{entity_name}` workflow functions.

This includes:

- In `/pets/query` endpoint:
  - Fetching pets from the external Petstore API remains in the endpoint (since it's external data retrieval).
  - The loop that adds each pet entity via `add_item` will remain in the endpoint (because it triggers persistence).
  - The enrichment/modification of each pet entity (adding timestamps, etc.) and any additional asynchronous tasks (like triggering events) will be moved into `process_pet`.
- The event trigger call `trigger_event_workflow("pet_query", ...)` will move into the workflow.
- Similarly, in `/pets/favorite` endpoint:
  - The logic of adding the favorite_pet entity remains in the endpoint (since it triggers persistence).
  - The event trigger `trigger_event_workflow("pet_favorite", ...)` will move into the workflow function `process_favorite_pet`.

---

### Changes planned:

1. **`process_pet(entity)` workflow:**

- Add enrichment logic (already present: add `"processedAt"` timestamp).
- Trigger event `"pet_query"` with relevant info.
- The event is about the query, but since pets are added individually, we might want to trigger event per pet or else add a new entity "pet_query_event" or similar.
- Since the event is about the query as a whole (with count), it should be done once for the whole query result, which is outside the workflow's scope (workflow is per entity).
- So **we cannot trigger the "pet_query" event inside `process_pet`**, because the workflow is called for each pet, and the event is about the whole query.

- Therefore, the event trigger for `"pet_query"` must remain in the endpoint.

- However, **any per-pet enrichment and async task can move to `process_pet`**.

2. **`process_favorite_pet(entity)` workflow:**

- Trigger event `"pet_favorite"`.

- This can be moved into workflow.

---

### Final approach:

- Keep external API calls and overall orchestration in endpoints.
- Move all entity-specific async tasks and event trigger calls to the appropriate workflow function **except** the "pet_query" event triggered once per query (outside the per-entity workflow).
- Modify workflows to be async functions and call async functions inside them.
- Return modified entity from workflow functions as required.

### Explanation:

- The `process_pet` workflow function now handles all async tasks related to pet entity enrichment. Currently, it adds a timestamp.
- The `process_favorite_pet` workflow triggers the `"pet_favorite"` event asynchronously, decoupling event logic from the controller.
- The `"pet_query"` event is still triggered in the `/pets/query` endpoint because it is about the whole query result (not per-entity).
- The endpoints are now slimmed down with business async logic moved to workflows.
- All calls to `entity_service.add_item` pass the appropriate workflow function.

This makes the codebase more robust, testable, and maintainable, following your requirements.

Let me know if you want me to help with further refactoring or adding workflows for other entities!
