Understood. The goal is to **move all async business logic from the endpoint handlers into the workflow function** `process_pet`, so that the controller simply receives validated data and calls `entity_service.add_item` with minimal logic. The workflow function will contain all side effects, async calls, enrichment, filtering, etc. This ensures controllers are thin, logic is centralized, and async tasks are properly encapsulated.

---

## What can be moved into `process_pet`?

Looking at the example `/pets/search` endpoint, the main logic is:

- Call external Petstore API to get pets by status.
- Filter pets by `type` (client-side).
- Transform the data.
- Persist each pet by calling `add_item` (currently done in the controller).
- Return the saved IDs.

Since the workflow function receives **one entity at a time**, and cannot add/update/delete the same entity model (to prevent recursion), we need to adjust the approach:

- The controller will receive the search parameters.
- The controller will create a **single "search request" entity** with the parameters.
- The workflow function `process_petsearch` (or similar) will run the async logic:
  - Call external API with the parameters.
  - Filter and transform results.
  - Save each pet via `entity_service.add_item` with `workflow=process_pet`.
- The controller returns immediately the search request id (or some acknowledgment).
- The actual pet entities are saved asynchronously inside the workflow.

This is a typical async "fire and forget" pattern.

---

## Proposed changes:

1. Create new entity model `petsearch` with workflow `process_petsearch` to perform the search logic and save pets.

2. Controller `/pets/search` will just add an entity of model `petsearch` with the search params, workflow runs and persists pets.

3. Workflow `process_pet` will handle any enrichment of pet entities before saving.

4. `/pets/fun-fact` endpoint does not persist entity, so no workflow needed.

5. `/pets` and `/pets/<id>` GET endpoints remain as is, just fetch from `entity_service`.

---

## Implementation details:

- Add workflow function `process_petsearch` that takes `entity` containing `type` and `status`.
- In `process_petsearch`:
  - Call external Petstore API with `status`.
  - Filter by `type` if provided.
  - For each pet:
    - Create a pet entity and call `entity_service.add_item` with `workflow=process_pet`.
- The controller `/pets/search` just calls `add_item` for model `petsearch` with the search params and workflow `process_petsearch`.

## Explanation:

- **`process_petsearch`** is the new async workflow function that executes the entire pet search logic asynchronously when a `petsearch` entity is added.
- The `/pets/search` endpoint now only creates a `petsearch` entity with input parameters and returns immediately.
- `process_petsearch` calls the external Petstore API, filters, and saves each pet entity using `entity_service.add_item` with `workflow=process_pet`.
- `process_pet` enriches each pet entity before persistence.
- This design removes all external calls and data processing from the controller and moves it into workflow functions.
- This also respects the rule that workflow functions cannot add/update/delete entities of their own model (to avoid recursion).
- GET endpoints remain thin and unchanged.

---

If you have other async logic or endpoints, you can apply the same pattern: create a dedicated workflow function named `process_{entity_name}`, move all async logic there, keep controller minimal.

Let me know if you want me to refactor any other parts or add detailed comments!
