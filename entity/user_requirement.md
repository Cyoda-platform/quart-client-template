## Detailed Summary of User Requirement

The user has expressed a clear intention to build an application focused on retrieving pet details based on specific statuses. The application is expected to support the following functionalities and aspects:

### 1. Retrieval of Pet Details
- **Functionality**: The primary goal is to create an application that can fetch or retrieve details related to pets.
- **Parameters**: The application should be able to filter pet details based on various statuses, which include:
  - **Available**: Pets that are currently available for adoption or sale.
  - **Sold**: Pets that have already been adopted or sold.
  - **Pending**: Pets that are in a pending status, possibly due to ongoing processes related to their adoption or sale.

### 2. Data Ingestion
- **Process**: The application must have a mechanism to ingest pet details from a data source, likely through external APIs that provide pet information.
- **Automation**: The data ingestion process should be automated, ensuring that the latest pet details are continuously fetched and updated within the application.

### 3. Entity Management
- **Entity Types**: It is implied that there will be at least two main entities involved in the application:
  - **Jobs (JOB)**: Responsible for orchestrating the data retrieval and ingestion processes.
  - **Raw Data Entities (EXTERNAL_SOURCES_PULL_BASED_RAW_DATA)**: To store the ingested pet details that have been pulled from the data source.

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
- The system should leverage an event-driven architecture that allows for seamless transitions between various states of the entities, particularly focusing on how jobs trigger the creation and updating of raw data entities.

### 5. User Interaction
- **User-Friendly**: The application should be designed with ease of use in mind, allowing users (potentially admins or pet adoption agencies) to efficiently retrieve and manage pet details based on the specified statuses.

### 6. Reporting and Monitoring
- While not explicitly mentioned in the initial requirement, it may be beneficial for the user to have reporting capabilities that summarize the pet details based on the statuses. This will support stakeholders in making informed decisions related to pet adoptions.

In summary, the user is looking to build an application that not only retrieves pet details based on their availability status but also incorporates an efficient data ingestion mechanism, a robust event-driven architecture, and user-friendly interaction for managing pet information. The design and functionality should ensure that the latest data is always accessible, promoting effective pet management and adoption processes.
